## Description 
This web application as stated earlier is based on a ghanaian naming sytem whereby children would be named as per their gender and the day they were born. What this web application does is it allows you to experience a diffrent style or culture of naming. If you were ghanian, what would your name be? All you have to do is scroll down to the bottom, enter your birthday and pick your gender then click submit. Once you have done this, you will recieve an alert telling you your Akan name. If you would like to take another go, click on the left arrow at the top left corner of the page and have another spin!!
